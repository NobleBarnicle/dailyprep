# Criminal Code Web Application Project Outline

Version: 0.1.0 Last Updated: 2024-02-07

## Vision
The vision for the web-app is a version of the Criminal Code of Canada built for busy criminal lawyers. The current government website has significant limitations in navigation, aesthetics, UI/UX, scrolling behavior, and mobile responsiveness. This project aims to create a superior alternative while serving as a learning experience in modern web development and LLM integration.
