# Planning 
- Date is March 3, 2025

## Next Steps for the Backend

1. **Code Quality Improvements**:
   - Update the FastAPI event handlers from the deprecated `on_event` to the recommended lifespan approach
   - Add more comprehensive error handling for database connection failures
   - Implement proper logging throughout the application

2. **API Enhancements**:
   - Add pagination metadata to all list endpoints (total pages, next/previous links)
   - Implement filtering options (e.g., by part, by type)
   - Add sorting capabilities to relevant endpoints
   - Improve search functionality with faceted search or filters

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Add caching for frequently accessed data
   - Optimize database queries
   - Implement connection pooling for better resource utilization

4. **Testing**:
   - Create unit tests for services and repositories
   - Develop integration tests for API endpoints
   - Set up automated testing with CI/CD

5. **Documentation**:
   - Enhance API documentation with more examples
   - Document the data model and relationships
   - Create developer guides for extending the application

6. **Security Enhancements**:
   - Implement proper CORS settings (currently set to "*")
   - Add rate limiting to prevent abuse
   - Consider adding authentication if needed

## Frontend Development

Since the backend is now functional, we could start focusing on the frontend development:

1. **Setup a Frontend Project**:
   - Initialize a React/Vue/Angular project based on the frontend plan
   - Configure build tools and development environment

2. **Core Components**:
   - Develop the main layout and navigation
   - Create components for displaying sections and search results
   - Implement the search interface

3. **Integration with Backend**:
   - Connect frontend to the API endpoints
   - Handle loading states and errors
   - Implement pagination and filtering UI

Would you like me to prioritize any of these areas, or would you prefer to focus on a specific aspect of the project next?
