# Frontend Development Plan

This document outlines the plan for developing the frontend of the Criminal Code web application.

## Technology Stack

We recommend using React with TypeScript for the frontend:

- **React**: A popular, performant JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better developer experience
- **React Router**: For client-side routing
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling components with a utility-first approach
- **React Query**: For data fetching, caching, and state management
- **Vite**: For fast development and optimized builds

## User Experience Considerations

1. **Responsive Design**
   - Mobile-first approach
   - Optimized reading experience on all devices

2. **Accessibility**
   - Proper semantic HTML
   - ARIA attributes for screen readers
   - Keyboard navigation

3. **Performance**

   - Offline access to previously viewed sections

## Development Process

1. **Setup and Configuration**
   - Set up React project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
   - Configure API client to connect to the backend

2. **Core Components Development**
   - Develop basic UI components and layouts
   - Implement navigation and routing

3. **Feature Implementation**
   - Table of contents navigation
   - Section viewing functionality
   - Search capabilities

4. **UI Polish and Testing**
   - Refine user interface and user experience
   - Test on various devices and browsers
   - Accessibility testing

5. **Deployment and Integration**
   - Build the frontend for production
   - Integrate with the backend API
   - Deploy to a hosting service

## Getting Started

To set up the frontend development environment:

```bash
# Create a new React project with Vite
npm create vite@latest frontend -- --template react-ts

# Navigate to the frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install react-router-dom @tanstack/react-query tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer

# Initialize Tailwind CSS
npx tailwindcss init -p

# Start development server
npm run dev
```
